- Compiled, executed and profiled 10+ HPC mini-applications including CCS-QCD, modylas-mini, miniVite, miniFE, etc.(most from ECP Proxy Applications suite)
- Analyzed the mini-apps' performance characteristics by identifying the math kernel, hotspot and bottleneck, and modeling their performance under Roofline Model, ECM Model, etc.
- Optimized them on specific platform according to the analysis result
