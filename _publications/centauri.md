<!-- 
Designed a distributed graph-based k Nearest Neighbor system, addressing the high memory usage issue
Proposed batching techniques to avoid communication costs between machines
Conducted experiments to validate the system, the result outperforming baseline in both memory usage and precision; Deployed the world largest graph-base kNN system (1 billion entries in dataset) -->

Submitted to IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium(IPDPS) 2020
